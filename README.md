# Fruit Quality Detection
- It is a Android based project which used a Deep Learning Model to identify the quality of various fruits.
- It can detect quality of 6 fruits:
	- Apple
	- Banana
	- Guava
	- Lime
	- Orange
	- Pomegranate
- It can classify the fruits into 3 categories:
	- Good
	- Bad
	- Mixed
- Android app is made using Java language targeted for devices upto Android 12.
- We have trained a Deep Learning model based on EfficientNetB5 which is a very good model in itself to classify images.

## How to run the application?
- You only need a android device running Android 8.0 or later.
- Install the [APK file](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Kunal-Attri/Fruit-Quality-Detection/main/FQD.apk) given in the root directory.
- App needs 2 permissions - Camera permission to take images and Files permission to read images from gallery.
